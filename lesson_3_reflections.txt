When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Well it makes sense in various situations. If for example I want to work with others on a project, it makes totally sense to have a common repository where all programmers can have access to the latest status of the code. But also for safety reasons: if I have all files just on my computer at home and something happens, e.g. the hard drive "dies" or a fire destroys your home, well at least your lines of code are stored somnewhere outside your home.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
